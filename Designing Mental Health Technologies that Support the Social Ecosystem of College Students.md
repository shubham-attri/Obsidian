## Introduction 

1. Mental health problems rising among college students: 2 states that there has been a significant increase in mental health problems among college students over the past decade. This includes issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress, which can have a negative impact on academic performance and overall well-being. 
2. College counseling centers struggling to meet demand: Due to the increase in mental health problems among college students, counseling centers on college campuses are struggling to keep up with the demand for services. This can result in long wait times for appointments and limited availability of resources. 
3. Digital mental health tools can expand reach of services: To address the challenges faced by college counseling centers, digital mental health tools offer a potential solution to expand the reach of mental health services for college students. These tools can provide students with access to mental health resources and support, regardless of their location or the availability of in-person services.

## Methods

The researchers conducted co-design workshops and individual interviews with college students and counseling center staff to identify their needs and preferences for digital mental health tools. The co-design workshops involved 30 participants, including 20 students and 10 counseling center clinicians. The individual interviews involved 19 participants, who were recruited through print advertisements on campus, emails sent through student organizations, and emails sent directly to co-design study participants who agreed to be contacted for future research. 

During the co-design workshops and individual interviews, participants were asked questions about their experiences with mental health services and their preferences for digital mental health tools. The researchers used these insights to develop a wireframe prototype of a stress management app for college students. The app was designed to address the needs and preferences identified by the participants.

Overall, the research methodology involved a participatory design approach, which involved engaging with stakeholders (i.e., college students and counseling center staff) to co-create a solution that meets their needs and preferences.


The study used a mixed-methods approach, including co-design workshops, individual design interviews, and focus groups, to gather data from multiple perspectives. Participants were recruited through print advertisements on campus, emails sent through student organizations, and emails sent directly to co-design study participants who agreed to be contacted for future research. Interested students were sent an online screening questionnaire to establish eligibility. The study was conducted at a single university in the United States.

Co-design workshops were conducted with groups of 6-8 students and lasted approximately 2 hours. Participants were asked to generate ideas for a stress management app for college students and provide feedback on each other's ideas. The workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed. 

Individual design interviews were conducted with 20 students and lasted approximately 45 minutes. The first 15-20 minutes of the interviews were focused on college student mental health care. Participants were then presented with a wireframe prototype of the stress management app for students that had been developed based on ideas generated during the co-design workshops. Participants were asked questions regarding design preferences. At the end of the interview, mock-ups of advertisements for the tool were presented to student participants to gain insights on how and in what settings they would like to learn about this new tool. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed.
Focus groups were conducted with counseling center staff to gather their perspectives on the needs and preferences of college students for digital mental health tools. The focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed.

The workshop and interview transcripts served as the primary data source and were analyzed by the authors using an inductive thematic analysis approach primarily focused on identifying semantic themes based on Braun and Clarkâ€™s methodology. Transcripts were read by two members of the study team, and preliminary codes were discussed between these two coders. A codebook was developed and coding was completed on all transcripts using the qualitative data analysis program NVivo. The authors met regularly throughout the analytic process to discuss the codes and ensure validity.
