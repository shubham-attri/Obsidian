## Introduction 


Mental health problems among college students have been increasing over the last decade, and college counseling centers are struggling to keep up with the demand for services. The paper suggests that digital mental health tools offer a potential solution to expand the reach of mental health services for college students.

1. Mental health problems rising among college students: 2 states that there has been a significant increase in mental health problems among college students over the past decade. This includes issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress, which can have a negative impact on academic performance and overall well-being. 
2. College counseling centers struggling to meet demand: Due to the increase in mental health problems among college students, counseling centers on college campuses are struggling to keep up with the demand for services. This can result in long wait times for appointments and limited availability of resources. 
3. Digital mental health tools can expand reach of services: To address the challenges faced by college counseling centers, digital mental health tools offer a potential solution to expand the reach of mental health services for college students. These tools can provide students with access to mental health resources and support, regardless of their location or the availability of in-person services.

## Methods

The researchers conducted co-design workshops and individual interviews with college students and counseling center staff to identify their needs and preferences for digital mental health tools. The co-design workshops involved 30 participants, including 20 students and 10 counseling center clinicians. The individual interviews involved 19 participants, who were recruited through print advertisements on campus, emails sent through student organizations, and emails sent directly to co-design study participants who agreed to be contacted for future research. 

During the co-design workshops and individual interviews, participants were asked questions about their experiences with mental health services and their preferences for digital mental health tools. The researchers used these insights to develop a wireframe prototype of a stress management app for college students. The app was designed to address the needs and preferences identified by the participants.

Overall, the research methodology involved a participatory design approach, which involved engaging with stakeholders (i.e., college students and counseling center staff) to co-create a solution that meets their needs and preferences.


The study used a mixed-methods approach, including co-design workshops, individual design interviews, and focus groups, to gather data from multiple perspectives. Participants were recruited through print advertisements on campus, emails sent through student organizations, and emails sent directly to co-design study participants who agreed to be contacted for future research. Interested students were sent an online screening questionnaire to establish eligibility. The study was conducted at a single university in the United States.

Co-design workshops were conducted with groups of 6-8 students and lasted approximately 2 hours. Participants were asked to generate ideas for a stress management app for college students and provide feedback on each other's ideas. The workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed. 

Individual design interviews were conducted with 20 students and lasted approximately 45 minutes. The first 15-20 minutes of the interviews were focused on college student mental health care. Participants were then presented with a wireframe prototype of the stress management app for students that had been developed based on ideas generated during the co-design workshops. Participants were asked questions regarding design preferences. At the end of the interview, mock-ups of advertisements for the tool were presented to student participants to gain insights on how and in what settings they would like to learn about this new tool. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed.
Focus groups were conducted with counseling center staff to gather their perspectives on the needs and preferences of college students for digital mental health tools. The focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed.

The workshop and interview transcripts served as the primary data source and were analyzed by the authors using an inductive thematic analysis approach primarily focused on identifying semantic themes based on Braun and Clarkâ€™s methodology. Transcripts were read by two members of the study team, and preliminary codes were discussed between these two coders. A codebook was developed and coding was completed on all transcripts using the qualitative data analysis program NVivo. The authors met regularly throughout the analytic process to discuss the codes and ensure validity.

## Key Findings

1. Rich social ecosystem and peer influence in college life: The research paper found that college student life is dominated by a rich social ecosystem, in which peer influence plays a significant role. This includes both known peers (i.e., close friends) and unknown peers (e.g., strangers found online who share mental health concerns). 
2. Known peers influence concepts of mental health and help-seeking: The study found that known peers have a significant influence on college students' concepts of mental health and help-seeking. Participants discussed the role of peer relationships as a resource for support, but also noted that some peer activities (e.g., using alcohol and drugs with friends to escape the stress of college life) were unhelpful for mental health. 
3. Desired digital tools to connect with known and unknown peers: The research paper found that college students desire digital mental health tools that allow them to connect with both known and unknown peers. Participants expressed a desire for tools that facilitate peer support and provide a sense of community. 
4. Non-peers like faculty also play supporting roles: While peer influence was found to be dominant in college student life, the study also found that non-peers like faculty can play supporting roles in mental health management. Participants discussed the importance of faculty support and the potential for digital mental health tools to connect students with faculty members who can provide guidance and support.

## Design Implications

1. Address lack of alone time and need for privacy: The research paper found that college students often lack alone time and privacy, which can make it difficult to engage with digital mental health tools. To address this, designers should consider incorporating features that allow students to engage with tools discreetly and at their own pace. 
2. Enable student-to-student mental health communication: The study found that college students desire digital mental health tools that enable communication with both known and unknown peers. Designers should consider incorporating features that facilitate peer support and provide a sense of community. 
3. Link tools to in-person activities and campus resources: The research paper found that college students desire digital mental health tools that are linked to in-person activities and campus resources. Designers should consider incorporating features that connect students with campus resources and provide information about mental health-related events and activities.
4. Emphasize general well-being over mental health branding: The study found that college students may be hesitant to engage with digital mental health tools that are branded as mental health resources. Designers should consider emphasizing general well-being and stress management, rather than mental health specifically, to reduce stigma and increase engagement.

## Conclusion 

1. Social roles and peer influence essential in college mental health: The research paper found that social roles and peer influence play an essential role in college student mental health. College students draw on a rich social ecosystem, including known and unknown peers, to manage their mental health.
2. Must account for this context in designing and implementing digital tools: The study highlights the importance of accounting for this social context when designing and implementing digital mental health tools for college students. Designers should consider incorporating features that facilitate peer support and provide a sense of community. 
3. Opportunities to improve acceptability and effectiveness of tools: The research paper identifies opportunities to improve the acceptability and effectiveness of digital mental health tools for college students. By incorporating features that address the lack of alone time and need for privacy, enable student-to-student mental health communication, link tools to in-person activities and campus resources, and emphasize general well-being over mental health branding, designers can create tools that better meet the needs and preferences of college students.

## Strengths of Paper

- The study provides valuable insights into the social context of college student mental health and the role of peer influence in shaping attitudes towards mental health and help-seeking. 
- The research paper identifies opportunities to improve the acceptability and effectiveness of digital mental health tools for college students, which can inform the design and implementation of future tools. 
- The study used a mixed-methods approach, including interviews, focus groups, and design activities, to gather data from multiple perspectives and provide a comprehensive understanding of the needs and preferences of college students and counseling center staff.

## Weakness of Paper

- The study was conducted at a single university, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other contexts.

- The study did not include a longitudinal follow-up to assess the effectiveness of the digital mental health tools developed based on the findings.

## Possible Future Work 

1. Perspective of students from rural areas: The study did not specifically focus on the needs and preferences of college students from rural areas. Future research could explore the unique challenges faced by these students, such as limited access to mental health resources and social isolation, and identify ways to design digital mental health tools that are tailored to their needs. 
2. Solving problems for different stakeholders: The study primarily focused on the needs and preferences of college students and counseling center staff. Future research could explore the perspectives of other stakeholders, such as mental health professionals, parents, and university administrators, to identify ways to design digital mental health tools that meet the needs of all stakeholders. 
3. Longitudinal follow-up: The study did not include a longitudinal follow-up to assess the effectiveness of the digital mental health tools developed based on the findings. Future research could conduct a longitudinal study to assess the long-term impact of digital mental health tools on college student mental health and well-being. 


 Overall, there is a need for continued research to improve the design and implementation of digital mental health tools for college students. By exploring the unique needs and preferences of different groups of students and stakeholders, researchers can develop tools that are tailored to the specific needs of each group and ultimately improve the mental health and well-being of college students.
