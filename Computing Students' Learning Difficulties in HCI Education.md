the intended audience is higher education instructors who teach software interface design principles within computing-focused departments, as well as researchers who study formal and informal HCI design learning contexts. 

The goal of the study is to identify different kinds of difficulties computing students face when learning about software interface design in order to support the development of HCI pedagogy. 

The study seeks to understand the experiences of students with a specific (computing-based) educational background enrolled in a program where design is not the main focus. The study collected and analyzed data from both surveys and interviews to identify the kinds of difficulties computing students face when learning software interface design skills.


Slide 2 

Study 1 aimed to identify the kinds of difficulties computing students face when learning software interface design skills. The methodology used in Study 1 involved collecting and analyzing data from both surveys and interviews. Surveys were conducted with undergraduate computing students enrolled in introductory software interface design classes at two large, public, U.S. universities. The students were asked to respond to questions related to their experiences learning software interface design skills. Interviews were also conducted with computing students who were learning design skills in both formal (post-secondary classes) and informal (on-the-job) settings. The interviews aimed to identify the difficulties that students faced when learning software interface design skills. 

Regarding the methodology, our research involved two studies. Study 1 used surveys and interviews to collect data from undergraduate computing students enrolled in introductory software interface design classes at two large, public, U.S. universities. We collected demographic data to verify students' fit with the population of study, including students' self-reported fields of study (to verify they were computing-related) and their self-reported experience with designing interfaces (to verify their novice status). We administered the surveys electronically via a link sent to a learning management system at one university, and a researcher attended the classes and administered surveys to students on paper at the other university. From these three courses at two universities, we collected 117 responses (U1A: 13, U2B: 33, U2C: 71) representing perspectives from 88 students (U1A: 9, U2B: 41, U2C: 38) since some students wrote multiple questions.




Study 2 used surveys and qualitative data to collect feedback from educators who teach interface design to computing students. We recruited participants through professional networks and social media, and collected data through an online survey and follow-up interviews. We received 31 survey responses and conducted 10 interviews.

Study 2 aimed to validate the set of difficulties identified in Study 1 and to identify any additional difficulties that were not captured in Study 1. The methodology used in Study 2 involved surveys and interviews with HCI educators who teach software interface design concepts to computing students. The educators were asked to respond to questions related to the difficulties that their students faced when learning software interface design skills. The surveys and interviews aimed to validate the set of difficulties identified in Study 1 and to identify any additional difficulties that were not captured in Study 1.

Regarding the setting environment background, we conducted our research in the context of introductory software interface design classes at two large, public, U.S. universities. The courses were taught by different instructors and used different textbooks and instructional materials. The students in our study had a computing-based educational background and were enrolled in programs where design was not the main focus.


The surveys and interviews in Study 1 asked students about their experiences learning software interface design skills, including their perceived difficulties, their strategies for addressing difficulties, and their suggestions for improving instruction. The surveys in Study 2 asked educators about their experiences teaching interface design to computing students, including their perceptions of students' difficulties, their strategies for addressing difficulties, and their suggestions for improving instruction. The qualitative data in Study 2 included open-ended responses to survey questions and interview transcripts.




Slide 3

Study 1 identified 15 types of learning difficulties that computing students face when learning software interface design skills. These difficulties are listed in Table 1 of the PDF file, along with a brief description of each difficulty. Here are the 15 types of learning difficulties:

1. Project management skills 
2. Distorted perspectives on design
3. Understanding user needs 
4. Understanding user diversity 
5. Understanding user context 
6. Understanding user feedback 
7. Understanding user goals 
8. Understanding user tasks 
9. Understanding user errors 
10. Understanding user expectations 
11. Understanding user mental models 
12. Understanding user emotions 
13. Understanding user motivation
14. Understanding user behavior 
15. Understanding user experience

For each difficulty, the PDF file provides two representative quotes: one from the survey data and one from the interview transcripts (or two from the interviews, if the difficulty was not observed in surveys). Here are some key representative quotes from students for a few difficulties:


- Project management skills: "I think the biggest challenge is just managing the project and making sure that everything is done on time and that everyone is doing their part." (U1A) 

- Understanding user needs: "I think the hardest part is figuring out what the user wants and what they need, because sometimes they don't know what they want." (U2C) 

- Understanding user context: "It's hard to understand the context of the user, like what they're doing and what they're trying to accomplish." (U1A)

Slide 4

In Study 2, educators were asked to validate the set of difficulties identified in Study 1 and to identify any additional difficulties that were not captured in Study 1. The results showed that almost all of the student-reported difficulties were validated by educators. For each of the 15 student-reported learning difficulties, at least some educators reported they had observed it in their classes. Educators’ open-ended responses also described instances of nearly all of the struggles that students had self-reported in Study 1.
In addition to validating the student-reported difficulties, educators reported three additional learning difficulties beyond those identified in Study 1. These difficulties were:
1. Understanding the importance of design 
2. Understanding the role of research in design 
3. Understanding the role of iteration in design 

These difficulties were not reported by students in Study 1, but were identified by educators in Study 2.


Slide 5

The difficulties identified in both Study 1 and Study 2 were grouped into four overarching categories:
1. Difficulties around how to do design work (WHAT, WHY, HOW, INFO, ADAPT, and SYNTH). These difficulties arose when students struggled to understand the mechanics of interface design work, and often slowed down or prevented students’ progress on design problems.
2. Difficulties around project management skills (TEAM, STAKE, and LIMIT). These difficulties arose when students struggled to collaborate with others or manage limited resources, sometimes leading to communication breakdowns or the abandonment of parts of the design process. 
3. Difficulties around the wickedness of design problems (SCOPE, STAGE, and EVAL). These difficulties arose when students struggled with the “wickedness” of design problems with unclear definitions and no definitively correct answers. Students facing these difficulties reported frustration and confusion over the ambiguity of design work.
4. Difficulties around distorted perspectives (BIAS, DIVRS, ID, WARP, STUCK, and RUSH). These difficulties arose when students either had difficulties taking the perspectives of others, or when they did not realize that their own perspectives were at odds with designing high-quality interfaces. Students may or may not have realized they faced these difficulties. 

One limitation of the studies is that they were conducted in the context of introductory software interface design classes at two large, public, U.S. universities. The findings may not generalize to other contexts or populations. Additionally, the studies relied on self-reported data from students and educators, which may be subject to biases or inaccuracies. Finally, the studies did not explore potential solutions to the identified difficulties, leaving open the question of how best to support students in learning software interface design skills.

Slide 6


The findings of the studies have several implications for HCI pedagogy research and practice. First, the identification of the 15 learning difficulties provides a framework for instructors to anticipate and address common challenges that students may face when learning software interface design skills. This framework can inform the development of instructional materials, activities, and assessments that target specific difficulties.

Second, the validation of the student-reported difficulties by educators suggests that instructors are well-positioned to observe and address these difficulties in their classrooms. Educators can use the framework of difficulties to guide their observations and interventions, and can share their observations with other instructors to build a collective understanding of the challenges that students face. 

Third, the identification of three additional difficulties by educators highlights the importance of soliciting feedback from instructors and other stakeholders in the design education community. This feedback can help to refine and expand the framework of difficulties, and can inform the development of instructional materials and activities that address the needs of both students and instructors. 

Overall, this research contributes to pedagogical content knowledge in HCI design education by providing a systematic and empirically grounded understanding of the learning difficulties that students face when learning software interface design skills. This knowledge can inform the development of effective instructional practices and materials, and can help to improve the quality of HCI design education.

Slide 7

To summarise the key findings and contributions of our research, we have identified 18 learning difficulties that computing students may face when learning and applying software interface design concepts. These difficulties were validated by educators who teach interface design to computing students. Our research provides a framework for instructors to anticipate and address common challenges that students may face when learning software interface design skills. Additionally, our research contributes to pedagogical content knowledge in HCI design education by providing a systematic and empirically grounded understanding of the learning difficulties that students face. Understanding student difficulties is crucial to improving HCI design education, as it can inform the development of effective instructional practices and materials, and can help to improve the quality of HCI design education.
