Task Description: Deploying and Stress Testing a GPT Model on an API
  

Objective:
The objective of this task is to deploy a heavy GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model of the size of 3-4 GB on an API, create basic tasks for the GPT as API calls, and then stress test the deployed model by simulating 10 concurrent users making requests to the API.

  

Tasks:

1. Deploy GPT Model on API:
    

	- Set up an API endpoint to receive requests and interact with the GPT model.
	    
	- Deploy the GPT model on the API platform (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions).
	    
	- Ensure that the API endpoint is secure and accessible.
	    

2. Implement Basic Tasks for GPT:
    

	- Define basic tasks for the GPT model, such as generating text based on prompts, summarizing text, or answering questions.
	    
	- Create API endpoints to handle these tasks (e.g., /generate-text, /summarize-text, /answer-question).
    

4. Stress Test with Concurrent Users:
    

	- Write a script to simulate 10 concurrent users making requests to the API.
	    
	- Each user should send a request to the API with different inputs (prompts, questions, etc.).
	    
	- Ensure that the requests are asynchronous and run concurrently.
	    

6. Monitoring Resource Consumption:
    

	- Monitor RAM consumption during the stress test to ensure it stays within acceptable limits.
	    
	- Implement logging to record the RAM consumption for each request.
    

8. Documentation:
    

	- Document the setup and configuration of the API endpoint and GPT model deployment.
	    
	- Record the details of the stress test, including the number of concurrent users, types of requests, and response times.
	    
	- Document the RAM consumption for each request and overall system performance during the stress test.
	    
	- Summarize the findings and provide recommendations for optimizing resource utilization.


Deliverables

1. Deployed GPT model on API with documentation.
    
2. Brownie points for more concurrent users than 10
    
3. Script for simulating 10 concurrent users.
    
4. Log file containing response times and RAM consumption for each user request.
    
5. Documentation summarizing the stress test results and recommendations for optimization.

Additional Points


	- Ensure that the API endpoint and GPT model are properly secured to prevent unauthorized access.
	    
	- Optimize the code for efficient resource utilization to minimize RAM consumption.
	    
	- Test the API endpoints thoroughly to ensure correct functionality and error handling.
	    
	- Collaborate with team members for assistance and guidance throughout the task.
