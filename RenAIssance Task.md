Here's a roadmap you can follow to solve the Transformer Architecture test (Test II) for the RenAIssance project:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Download the specific dataset provided (PDF scans and transcribed text reference).
   - Convert the PDF scans to individual image files (e.g., PNG or JPG) for easier processing.
   - Split the image data into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., first 20 pages for training, next 5 for validation, and last 6 for testing).
   - Preprocess the images (e.g., normalization, resizing, data augmentation) as per the requirements of your chosen transformer model.

2. **Choose a Transformer Architecture**:
   - Research and select an appropriate transformer architecture for the optical character recognition (OCR) task, such as Transformer-OCR, ROVER, or any other state-of-the-art model.
   - Understand the architecture and its components (e.g., encoder, decoder, attention mechanisms).

3. **Implement the Transformer Model**:
   - Set up your development environment (e.g., Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow).
   - Implement the chosen transformer architecture, either from scratch or by adapting an existing implementation.
   - Incorporate any necessary modifications or enhancements to the architecture based on your research and the specific requirements of the task.

4. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - Define the evaluation metrics you will use to measure the model's performance (e.g., Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error Rate (WER), or any other relevant metrics).
   - Set up the training procedure, including data loaders, loss functions, and optimization algorithms.
   - Train the transformer model on the training set, using the transcribed text as the ground truth.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set periodically during training.
   - Once training is complete, evaluate the model's performance on the test set (the last 6 pages without transcriptions) to assess its generalization capability.

5. **Experimentation and Refinement**:
   - Experiment with different hyperparameters, data augmentation techniques, or architectural modifications to improve the model's performance.
   - Analyze the model's performance on different subsets of the data (e.g., specific fonts, layouts, or text styles) and identify areas for improvement.
   - Iterate on the model design, training process, or data preprocessing as needed.

6. **Documentation and Submission**:
   - Document your approach, including the chosen transformer architecture, data preprocessing steps, training procedure, and evaluation results.
   - Discuss the evaluation metrics used and provide insights into the model's performance, strengths, and limitations.
   - Prepare a GitHub repository or Jupyter notebook with your code and documentation.
   - Submit your work (CV, code repository/notebook, and PDF of the notebook with output) to human-ai@cern.ch with the subject line "Evaluation Test: RenAIssance".

Throughout the process, feel free to reach out to the organizers or mentors for any clarification or assistance you may need. Additionally, make sure to follow best practices for reproducible research, code organization, and documentation.



First extract the dataset and split it, split it accordingly
Then using the TrOCR-base-str model, fine tune it on our dataset 
then use various evaluation metrics and test the results.
