**Introduction** 

The main goal of the research paper is to explore how text generation models can be used to support vocabulary learning in a fun and engaging way. 

The key features of the Storyfier system include the ability to generate stories based on target words, provide adaptive assistance in writing practices, and support reading, cloze test, and writing activities for vocabulary learning. 

The system is powered by controllable language models that can generate stories given any target words and provide adaptive assistance when using these words in writing practices. 

The authors evaluate the effectiveness of Storyfier in a within-subjects experiment with English-as-Second-Language Chinese students, and discuss insights from their findings for leveraging generative models to support learning tasks.



**Methodology** 


the study was conducted by a team of researchers from several universities in China and the United States, and it involved a series of interviews and experiments with English teachers and university students in China.

The study was designed to address the limitations of existing vocabulary learning support tools, which often rely on rote memorization and fail to engage learners in meaningful and enjoyable activities. The researchers hypothesized that generating stories with target words could provide a more engaging and effective way to learn vocabulary.

To test this hypothesis, the researchers developed a two-phase design and development process for a tool called Storyfier. In the first phase, they developed a controllable language model that could generate stories with given target word sets. They used the ROCStory corpus to contextualize CET-4 words and build story generation models. The ROCStory corpus collects over 100,000 five-sentence commonsense human-written stories. In the second phase, they worked with English teachers and university students to refine and evaluate Storyfier through a series of interviews and experiments.

The interviews were conducted with three English teachers and five university students in China. The teachers had experience teaching IELTS, high-school English, and TOEFL writing, while the students were well-experienced in using different English vocabulary learning software for Chinese. The interviews were semi-structured and focused on participants' practices of story-based activities for teaching or learning vocabulary, as well as their feedback on the Storyfier tool. 

The experiments involved a within-subjects study with 30 university students in China. The students were randomly assigned to use either Storyfier or a control tool for vocabulary learning. They completed pre- and post-tests to measure their vocabulary knowledge and retention, and they also provided feedback on their experience using the tools.

Overall, the study aimed to provide a rigorous and evidence-based approach to exploring the potential of story generation models for vocabulary learning. The researchers used a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to gather data and evaluate the effectiveness of their tool, and they drew on insights from both teachers and students to inform their design decisions.




**Designing of the Storyfier**

The design and development process of the Storyfier system involved several phases, including the development of a story generation model, the design of a user interface, and the implementation of a prototype system. Here is a summary of the process:

1. Story generation model: The authors trained a controllable language model using a large corpus of English text. The model was fine-tuned using various techniques, including key words, story valence, and control codes, to generate stories based on target words and other user preferences.

2. User interface design: The authors designed a user interface that included three modes of interaction: story reading, cloze test, and turn-taking writing. The interface allowed users to manually add or delete target words, and to look up the definition, part of speech, and usage examples of each word. The interface also provided adaptive assistance in writing practices, such as suggesting synonyms and providing feedback on grammar and coherence.

3. Prototype implementation: The authors implemented a prototype system called Storyfier, which integrated the story generation model and the user interface. The system allowed users to select a target word set, read a story generated based on the target words, complete a cloze test to reinforce their understanding of the words, and write a new story using the target words with adaptive assistance.


Overall, the design and development process of the Storyfier system involved a combination of machine learning techniques and user-centered design principles to create a system that is both effective and engaging for vocabulary learning.

Designing space



The researchers conducted a within-subjects study with 28 ESL students to explore the impact of Storyfier on vocabulary learning outcomes, experience, and perceptions. The study design involved two factors: AI vs no AI and read-only vs read-cloze-write. 

The AI factor aimed to study the impacts of Storyfier's AI-generated story and adaptive writing support. The read-only vs read-cloze-write factor aimed to evaluate the impact of the cloze test and writing practices by comparing the participants' performance and experience in read-only and read-cloze-write sessions. 

The study design was within-subjects, which means that each participant experienced both conditions (AI vs no AI and read-only vs read-cloze-write) in a counterbalanced order. This design helped to control for individual differences in learning ability and motivation.

The researchers measured learning outcomes using pre- and post-tests to assess participants' vocabulary knowledge and retention. They also collected data on participants' experience and perceptions of using the tool, including their satisfaction, engagement, and perceived usefulness.

Overall, the study design was carefully designed to explore the impact of Storyfier on vocabulary learning outcomes, experience, and perceptions. The within-subjects design helped to control for individual differences, and the use of multiple measures helped to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the tool.




**Summary** 


The main insights gained from the study are: 
1. Text generation models can be effective in supporting vocabulary learning by providing personalized and engaging content. 

3. The quality of story generation can be improved by incorporating more complex stories with a wide range of narrative structures into the dataset for model training. 

1. The use of generative models may not always lead to better learning outcomes in certain learning contexts, such as read-cloze-test sessions.

the researchers found that Storyfier's AI features reduced learning gains in read-cloze-write sessions, which suggests that learners may need to spend more effort in writing practices to achieve better learning outcomes. 

However, the additional cloze and writing practices did improve learning outcomes compared to read-only activities. 

The users favored the generated stories and writing assistance provided by the tool, which suggests that these features were helpful in supporting vocabulary learning. However, the researchers also noted that it is important to ensure that learners spend the necessary effort in their learning, even with the help of AI features. 

Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the use of generative models for supporting vocabulary learning. The findings suggest that while AI features can be helpful, they should be designed to encourage necessary effort in learners and support multiple strands of vocabulary learning activities.


Strengths of the paper:

* Weaknesses of the paper:** 

1. The sample size of the within-subjects experiment is relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.
2. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the quality of the generated stories, such as coherence and interestingness, beyond the feedback from the participants. 
3. The paper does not compare the effectiveness of Storyfier with other existing vocabulary learning tools, which may limit the understanding of its relative advantages and disadvantages.

 
**Potential future work:**

1. Conduct larger-scale experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of Storyfier in different learning contexts and with different learner populations. 

2. Explore the use of more sophisticated evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of text generation models in supporting vocabulary learning.

3. Investigate the use of other machine learning techniques, such as few-shot learning and prompting, to further enhance the effectiveness of language learning tools.

4. Develop more diverse and high-quality training data for language models to improve the quality of story generation.
